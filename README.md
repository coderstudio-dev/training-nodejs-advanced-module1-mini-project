# training-nodejs-advanced-module1-mini-project

Project: Develop a command-line task manager that schedules and logs tasks using asynchronous operations and custom events.
We'll use Promises and async/await for file operations and task scheduling. We can use Node.js to create a Command Line Interface (CLI) application where commands are passed as parameters with the following commands:

`add`: To schedule a new task. For example, `node task.js add "<task name?>" <duration>`

`list`: To list all scheduled tasks. For example, `node task.js list`

`log`: To view the log of completed tasks. For example, `node task.js log`
